*stackreg* is a Vim plugin to provide stackable registers.  If you delete or
yank a text without specifying a register, the text will be pushed into
a stack.  If you put without specifying a register, a text will be popped from
the stack then it will be put.

The concept of stackable registers is derived from Vz which is an editor for
MS-DOS and it was widely used in Japan since 1989.

Requirements:
- Vim 7.2 or later
- |advice| 0.0.0 or later (vimscript#2402)
